 ideology_tbo_agrarian: "agrarian"
 ideology_tbo_agrarian_desc: "Agrarians hold that most of modernization's impacts have been or will be negative. Factories pollute air, water, and soil, while in cramped cities men become isolated from their neighbors and family. The cities, like giant monsters of steel, have swallowed the souls of the men who foolishly wander within, while scraping the increasingly barren land clear of all but soot-infused wastes.\n\nAn adherence to subsistence traditions, they maintain, is the solution. When the nation is not running itself down for a few percentage-points of economic growth but instead promoting harmony, stability, and the natural cultivation of nourishing produce, it may then truly free itself from the sisyphean struggles of modernity and place itself firmly on the packed dirt road to enlightenment."
 ideology_tbo_interventionist: "interventionist"
 ideology_tbo_interventionist_desc: "Interventionism was born in reaction to the raw horrors of the first waves of industrialization. These men saw the destructive power of industry, how it swallowed men, even women, *children*, ground them up and spat out their crushed remains. Yet they saw the enormous potential of it too, when the countryside was submerged beneath a sea of steel and figures were ticked out on endless sheets and entire cities sprang from where there had previously been nothing.\n\nThe interventionists set out to resolve this contradiction. They believed they could constrain the market, harness its power with the reins of the state. They avoided the pitfalls of the Centralists and Collectivists, who foolishly believed the market could fall under the power of men. They skirted the errors of the deregulationists, who played with a fire they could not control. In the narrow ground between the scorched paths they forged a new road, not to any lofty ideal, but forward, a great financial ship forever at sea."
 ideology_tbo_primitivist: "primitivist"
 ideology_tbo_primitivist_desc: "Primitivists reject industry as the root of all problems of modernity, in a similar vein to agrarians, yet they go a step further. While agrarians merely wish for the nation's economic focus to return to agriculture, primitivists instead advocate for the total dismantling of all industry.\n\nIt can be clearly seen that industry corrupts the hearts and minds of men; only a return to the ages of raw flesh can purify the modern soul."
 ideology_tbo_collectivist: "collectivist"
 ideology_tbo_collectivist_desc: "Collectivism began to emerge following the development of truly modern socialist ideas, and advocates for the collective ownership of the workplace. After all, it is they who produce the goods. Is it not justified that they should receive the fruits of their labor, rather than the wealthy few who leech off their blood and sweat?\n\nSimilar ideals have existed since time immemorial, and a primitive pseudo-form of collectivism was present in the years of stone and clay, yet in those days equality was an equality of poverty. Today, with advances in science propelling a burgeoning industry, true realization of the scientific and methodical collectivist ideal is at last at hand."
 ideology_tbo_centralist: "centralist"
 ideology_tbo_centralist_desc: "Centralism was born following collectivism, yet rivals the former in dedicated literature and philospohy. The collective ownership of the workplace is the ideal, yes, but the mistake of the collectivists was to view their society as a rose in a vaccum. But a beautiful ideal. surrounded by capitalist powers, will only be doomed to invasion, destruction, and post-morten glorification.\n\nNew developments in mathematics have outlined a new possibility: the state's direct planning of the economy, where foresight and efficient resource allocation on a national scale propels unprecedented speeds of development, where full modernization can transform even a backwards agrarian state to an industrial powerhouse.\n\n"But at what cost?" the idealists will say. Friends, do you expect the workers to place a price tag on their survival?"
 ideology_tbo_traditionalist: "traditionalist"
 ideology_tbo_traditionalist: "Before there was all this nonsense of production, efficiency, investments and all the new-fangled terms the economists have invented to dazzle us with, there was the time-tested traditional economy. Serfs labored joyfully on their land, and their benevolent rulers lived in harmony with them fro their majestic castles. And so, for thousand of years, stability reigned.\n\nToday the economy is like a ship rocked by a storm---the storm of industrialization. The ship rocks this way and that, and all the petty economic systems are shouted loudly like desperate commands by terrified sailors. Yet the traditionalist is intelligent. Like any commonsense gentleman, he sits in a dignified manner at his post and waits inevitably for the storm to pass."
 ideology_tbo_deregulationist: "deregulationist"
 ideology_tbo_deregulationist_desc: "The first whistles of steam heralded the liberation of humanity from the feudal order, unveiling a new force: the market, as powerful and immovable as the laws that govern the motions of the celestial bodies. Some fools wish to cast reigns upon the market, or even to control it. Yet they have all but failed, and the deregulationist throne triumphs above the financial accomplishments of the greatest empires of the world.\n\nThe invisible hand in its almighty workings navigates the economy forward, at time through rough waters, but always true to its destination. Who are we to attempt to meddle with its cryptic workings?"
 ideology_tbo_reactionary: "reactionary"
 ideology_tbo_reactionary_desc: "As science and philosophy have advanced through the past two centuries, there has inevitably been backlash against these extreme new ideas. The reactionaries say that the world worked fine before, with the beautiful ideals of a racially pure nation with a populace living in harmony. Time, along with external forces, whether a foreign religion, culture, or ethnicity, have dampened this greatness into a faintly glowing shell of its former self.\n\nWhen prosperous times inevitably end and economic downturn strikes, the reactionaries appear, and so begin their solutions to restore the greatness of their nation."
 ideology_tbo_conservative: "conservative"
 ideology_tbo_conservative_desc: "Without the bite of reactionaries, conservatives still hold that society was better in the past. The modern man is corrupted; he foolishly offers 'rights' and 'freedoms' to those less than deserving of equality of the state. No, things are better as they are now than they will be, and things were better then than they are now.\n\nThe old nobilities of europe are quite fond of conservativism, and from their manors they sigh at the mantle and look back fondly upon an age when their ancestors ruled the countryside like kings."
 ideology_tbo_progressive: "progressive"
 ideology_tbo_progressive_desc: "The enlightenment brought about an exciting new wave of philosophies for a more egalitarian world. Suddenly, possibilities appeared; concepts like natural rights and a democratic governance appeared, and the spark of revolutions spread across Europe.\n\nThen the Britannian era drew open with its majestic velvet curtains, and the revolutionary glow faded. Suddenly, it became quite fashionable for proper gentlemen to dabble in a little progressivism; talks of a cabinet today, and a draft for a worthless parliament tomorrow. The fervor of the failed French revolution lives on, corrupted, in the flashing lights, laughter, and clinking of wine-glasses in the political salons scattered across the great cities of the world like festering sores on a diseased Europe."
 ideology_tbo_radical: "radical"
 ideology_tbo_radical_desc: "Perhaps the original progressive ideals were washed away by the might of Greater Britannia, but its spirit lives on. In the frozen wastes of distant continents, in the taigas and grasslands spared by the iron advances of Britannia's invincible armies, the radical flame burns "
 ideology_tbo_pacifist: "pacifist"
 ideology_tbo_pacifist_desc: "Pacifists believe that militaries are the root of evil, and that a nation free of an army is one where peace and prosperity can be achieved."
 ideology_tbo_isolationist: "isolationist"
 ideology_tbo_isolationist_desc: "Isolationists believe that a limited military is necessary even in times of peace to deter foreign threats."
 ideology_tbo_jingoist: "jingoist"
 ideology_tbo_jingoist_desc: "Jingoists believe in a powerful military, whether for foreign conquest or defense against powerful neighbors."
 ideology_tbo_social_darwinist: "social darwinist"
 ideology_tbo_social_darwinist_desc: "The social darwinists believe "
