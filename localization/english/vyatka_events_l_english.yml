  vyatka_events.1.d: "General Pyotr Nezhdanov is bothered by visions in his sleep of... eyes?"
  vyatka_events.1.f: "Warlords were to be ruthless. It was a fact of life, and something that Pyotr had gradually come to learn over the time following Area Eastland's collapse. Occasionally he was bothered by the acts he was forced to perform---and at such a young age, too, when the heart had not yet hardened---but, as with all things, he supposed it was inevitable. He had ordered several officers executed already, but it was not his fault: they were conspiring against him, the poisons found within their rooms a testimony to their guilt. He would have to kill many more in the years to come, a thought which had once unsettled him but did so less every day now.\n\nA new sence of normalcy had come over his life, and now the only thing that bothered him were the visions.\n\nWhen he was lying in his gilded bed at night, he would sometimes close his eyes and a strange vision would wash over him. A beautiful pair of eyes floated past his field of view, a deep shade of brown that probed his soul, stripped the hard layers away from him and left him raw and afraid. It was an unsettling sensation. He did not like what it reminded him of: weakness, which he knew he would rid himself of eventually."
  vyatka_events.2.t: "An encounter on the Severnyes"
  vyatka_events.2.d: "Pyotr encounters his dream at last, on the sandy slopes of the Severnye hills"
  vyatka_events.2.f: "Pyotr had once loved to roam the Severnye Hills just ouside Vyatka as a child. The cool wind had blown against his face, and around him the trees almost seemed to absorb sound. Those memories were fading into the recesses of his mind now, and it troubled him to find he could not recall much of how he had once spent so many of his days out here, amid nature, doing whatever he pleased. He had not even returned to the hills for quite some time. It had been... what, a year? Two years? His entourage insisted on travelling with him, but he had denied them this. The hills would be his own again, for however fleeting a time."
