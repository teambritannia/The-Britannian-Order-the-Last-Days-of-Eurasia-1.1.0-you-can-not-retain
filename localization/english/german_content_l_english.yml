 je_german_british_split: "Relations between [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] and [SCOPE.sCountry('ger_scope').GetNameNoFormatting]"
 german_complete: "Anti-Britannian factions have won over the populace and have completely broken off friendly terms with Greater Britannia"
 je_german_british_split_reason: "The relative peace between [SCOPE.sCountry('ger_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] and [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] following the European wars cannot last. With the public in an increasingly powerful [SCOPE.sCountry('ger_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] unsatisfied with being subservient to [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetNameNoFormatting]'s authority, the split of relations between the two countries is not a question of if, but when."
 
 german_army_limits: "Limits on the [SCOPE.sCountry('ger_scope').GetAdjective] Army"
 german_army_limits_reason: "[SCOPE.sCountry('ger_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] helped [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] succeed in her first wars across Europe, but it has become quite evident that the Empire of the Sun does not intend to share its glory with a relatively new competitor in the international stage, going as far as to forcefully impose a limit on the size of the [SCOPE.sCountry('ger_scope').GetAdjective] army:sixty percent of the [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetAdjective] army. No more, no less."
 
 german_british_split.1.t: "Germany, forever"
 german_british_split.1.d: "Starting situation of Germany"
 german_british_split.1.f: "During the great Conquests Germany aided Britannia in her wars across the globe, and in return she was made whole again with the blessing of the world's most powerful empire. \n\nYet Britannian arrogance towards the newly reborn Germany has angered many. Now, German-Britannian relations seem to be headed towards an inevitable collapse. With only her subjects in Scandinavia, Africa, and Italy standing behind her, how will Germany fare when faced with the wrath of a domineering Britannia?"
 german_british_split.1.a: "May the world tremble before the might of [SCOPE.sCountry('ger_scope').GetNameNoFormatting]!"
 german_british_split.2.t: "[SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] demands tribute"
 german_british_split.2.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] is demanding that the German State pay a tribute for five years"
 german_british_split.2.f: ""Damn Britannians, thinking they can shove us around like that," Hans muttered, ruffling his collar. It was hot inside the building, with the sun staring down the window and onto the scattered papers strewn about his desk. To pay, or not to pay?\n\nIt was a difficult question, one that plagued Hans as much as he knew it plagued the leaders of [SCOPE.sCountry('ger_scope').GetNameNoFormatting], God save the Kaiser. They had had enough of such disgraces, fit for a backwards nation like the Chinese Federation or India. For a proud, modern state like [SCOPE.sCountry('ger_scope').GetNameNoFormatting]... this was disgraceful treatment!\n\nHans worked himself into a rage as he walked round and round the room, becoming more agitated with each step. [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetNameNoFormatting]! Lounging on their islands and sucking the blood of Germans. Honest, hard-working Germans!\n\nBy this point, Hans had worked himself into a frothing rage, but forced himself to sit down. His decision of course would be by no means final, but what was it to be? Submit, or defy?"
 german_british_split.2.a: "Blast. We'll pay the tribute."
 german_british_split.2.b: "Bow to [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetNameNoFormatting]? Never!"
 german_british_split.3.t: "Army speaks out against Britannian domination"
 german_british_split.3.d: "Prominent figures in the Army of Germany have given speeches encouraging popular sentiments against Greater Britannia"
 german_british_split.3.f: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('galeader').GetFullName] has given a speech in Berlin speaking against the influence Greater Britannia holds over Germany. While the speech was scheduled for three in the afternoon, a significant crowd had already gathered by noon, and by the time [SCOPE.sCharacter('galeader').GetLastName] arrived the crowd had grown restless enough as to damage several [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetAdjective] assets near the plaza.\n\nMany have been alarmed by the inflammatory nature of [SCOPE.sCharacter('galeader').GetLastName]'s speech, and the [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetAdjective] embassy has already issued a strong objection, requesting that the German Army be purged of anti-Britannian elements. With pro-[SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetAdjective] politicians dominating the intelligentsia in [SCOPE.sCountry('ger_scope').GetNameNoFormatting], many have turned to the disgruntled army as a savior and a symbol of reclamation of German national pride."
 german_british_split.3.a: "Such is the spirit of a real German!"
 german_british_split.3.b: "These dangerous sentiments must be contained!"
 german_british_split.3.c: "This is unacceptable. Imprison [SCOPE.sCharacter('galeader').GetLastName]!"
 german_british_split.4.t: "To silence a dissident voice"
 german_british_split.4.d: "Britannian authority demands we arrest participants in an anti-Britannian demonstration"
 german_british_split.4.f: "The Britannian embassy has contacted us regarding the recent ani-Britannian protest, where several storefronts selling Britannian stock were defaced, and Complete National Autonomy slogans were seen carried on banners. The embassy has criticized us for our apathy in not immediately arresting the whole lot of them, demanding that we place all identified participants in prison.\n\nSignificant opposition has already sprung from the ground up, and it has become clear the rabble will not take kindly to our arrest of these demonstrators."
 german_british_split.4.a: "Very well. We'll hunt them down."
 german_british_split.4.b: "Arrest? These men are heroes!"
 german_var_subtract_5_tt: "Progress of the German-British split will decrease by 5"
 german_var_add_10_tt: "Progress of the German-British split will increase by 10"
 german_british_split.5.t: "Demilitarization controls"
 german_british_split.5.d: "In response to our perceived militarization in [SCOPE.sState('army_state').GetName], Greater Britannia has offered to overlook our activities in exchange for our providing of military goods to them."
 german_british_split.5.f: "The presence of our barracks at [SCOPE.sState('army_state').GetName] have drawn Britannian ire. Accusing us of secretly rebuilding our military in spite of restrictions, they have demanded we dismantle all military "
 german_british_split.6.t: "The matter of Austria"
 german_british_split.6.d: "Germany has completely renounced their ties with us. We must do everything in our power to weaken them before they recover militarily."
 german_british_split.6.f: "While having far-reaching consequences, the split in relations between [SCOPE.sCountry('ger_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] and [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] was nowhere near unexpected, as tension between the two nations stemming from disputes around specific terms in the Pact of Steel have been raging since near the beginning of the century. The German Military has siezed control of the government, directing their diplomats to renounce the Pact of Steel and the [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetAdjective] protection it entails.\n\nGermany itself is vast even without its subjects, and without the military restrictions placed upon it the nation is expected to develop a powerful military in the coming years. One particular enticing proposal is to force the Germans to cede more land to Poland, as well as to release its southern regions to a new subject in Austria."
 german_british_split.6.a: "We will go through with this proposal. [SCOPE.sCountry('ger_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] must never threaten our power."
 german_british_split.6.b: "We have more important things to worry about."
 german_british_split.7.t: "The deannexation of Austria"
 german_british_split.7.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] demands we cede land to Poland and release Austria"
 german_british_split.7.f: "[SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] has not taken kindly to our breaking of relations with them. While they have not resorted to outright invasion yet, seeking to preserve the balance in Europe, they have demanded that we cede East and West Galicia to Poland, and most of our southern territories to a new subject in Austria. The lands would still be under our jurisdiction in name with the reichskommissariat system, but [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetAdjective] no doubt seeks to sow disorder withind the Bund by dangerously empowering our puppets. There is always refusal, and the war it entails. The choice is ours."
 german_british_split.7.a: "Tell them we surrender."
 german_british_split.7.b: "This means war!"
