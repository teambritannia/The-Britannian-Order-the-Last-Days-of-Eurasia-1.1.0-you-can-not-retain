 britannian_prosperity.1.t: "The Britannian Prosperity"
 britannian_prosperity.1.d: "'The greatest nations of the world / arund the sun like jewels twirlled..."
 britannian_prosperity.1.f: "No empire of the past could compare to Greater Britannia as she stood, and a good chance was there that none of the future would ever come close to matching her splendor, if they were to exist at all. For, as the Cromwells will insist, ruling from London, the highest authority on the planet, Britannia is truly eternal.\n\nIn the first wars in Europe she routed the French and Spanish; in the second she crushed Russia. In the second Asian wars all the power of the orient could not withstand the iron tide from the Isles; and Africa in her entirety plunged into a turbulent anarchy. Indeed, no power in the world would even dare think of defying her, any more than a fish would wish to jump upon land."
 britannian_prosperity.1.a: "Hail Britannia! Hail Cromwell! Heil Britannia! Heil Cromwell!"
 
 je_britannian_prosperity_reason: "Greater Britannia, on the surface, seems to be in an eternal golden age. Yet upon closer inspection of the Empire Under the Sun reveals that its position is, in fact, quite precarious. As nationalist sentiments rise across its conquered territories, only time will tell whether the Britannian Empire will survive into the twentieth century in its full glory."
 je_britannia_collapse_tt: "Should various colonial wars overwhelm Britannia's might, the Empire will lose control over its expansive holdings, resigned to an uncertain fate for the remaining Home Islands..."

 britannian_prosperity.3.t: "The Mexican War"
 britannian_prosperity.3.d: "Mexico has declared war on Britannia-controlled North Mexico in a bid to reclaim its lost lands"
 britannian_prosperity.3.f: "Mexico had declared war on Greater Britannia! Quite an unexpected development, thought the thousands of civil servants busied with administrative work in what many were already triumphantly crowning the Capital of the World. To put down this minor menace on the border; well, it would take little more than a few battalions shipped across the world to deal with this annoyance of a diplomatic situation.\n\nA few entertained the thoughts of what might happen should more of these diplomatic situations arise, but soon shook them off. No, Greater Britannia would stand forever, no matter what a little egotistical state a little to the west of nowhere would demand they recognize."
 britannian_prosperity.3.a: "Britannia lives."
 britannian_prosperity.4.t: "The Britannian Opportunity"
 britannian_prosperity.4.d: "A war between Britannia and Mexico presents an opportunity for Dai Nam to place Britannian Indochina under its control"
 britannian_prosperity.4.f: "Many in Dai Nam have been advocating for an incursion into Britannian Indochina. The patchwork state has long been neglected by Britannian home authorities, and the focus on Mexico currently means that a sudden Vietnamese invasion will, provided sufficient speed, crush the Indochinese dominion before Britannia is even able to retaliate. The only question is, will the leaders of Dai Nam take on this reckless but potentially massively rewarding task?"
 britannian_prosperity.4.a: "Chance!"
 britannian_prosperity.4.b: "This plan is insane!"
 britannian_prosperity.5.t: "The Vietnam War"
 britannian_prosperity.5.d: "Capitalizing on the opportunity of Britannia's war against Mexico, Dai Nam has declared war to take control of Britannian Indochina."
 britannian_prosperity.5.f: "The Britannian embassy was woken in the morning by Vietnamese cannons blasting down its walls. The entire city had been overwhelmed quickly, the garrison slaughtered by the quick advance. They had not been expecting an attack, having the full backing of the Britannian Army \n\n Amid crumbling walls the Vietnamese troops advanced through crumbling and scorched walls, confident that they were to bring about a new future for their country."
 britannian_prosperity.5.a: "This is a disaster!"
 
 tt_tribute_cooldown: "Has not demanded tribute from Germany in the past two years"
 
 rebel_victoria.1.t: "The Rebel Victoria"
 rebel_victoria.1.d: "Situation of the traitor Alexandrina Victoria and her treacherous anti-Britannian organization"
 rebel_victoria.1.f: "Even as the mighty Greater Britannian Empire struggles to hold on to its vast colonial holdings, the empire's home isles, its most precocious core, are not safe, either. Had the Cromwells not taken over Britain then Alexandrina Victoria might've had a chance at the throne, however far-fetched a hope.\n\n Yet now she leads, or at least is suspected to lead, a loose coalition termed by the press as the 'black hand'. Having already carried out several high-profile assassinations on important public officials, they are a dangerous force to the stability of Greater Britannia."
 rebel_victoria.1.a: "We will keep a close eye on this situation"
 rebel_victoria.2.t: "Black Hand shoots [SCOPE.sCharacter('deadguy_scope').GetFullName]"
 rebel_victoria.2.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('deadguy_scope').GetFullName] has been shot by Victoria's rebels in London"
 rebel_victoria.2.f: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('deadguy_scope').GetFirstName] looked at his watch and frowned. The train was running late; it was already a minute or so past the time it was supposed to have arrived. For a public figure as important as himself this was an utter disgrace to his dignity; it was already outrageous that it had not arrived early for him.\n\n Bored, he surveyed the crowd and took in the other passengers, many of whom seemed strangely unbothered by this irritating disruption that would throw his delicately packed schedule completely out of balance. The filthy masses crowded left and right, with worn caps peeking over the sea of heads. One carried a large package that required his full strength to lift. Another carefully held an ornate wooden box that looked to be some kind of heirloom. They did not concern [SCOPE.sCharacter('deadguy_scope').GetLastName]; he was above the rabble. He was a servant of Greater Britannia, of the greatest empire of the world.\n\n He did not think that anyone would dare to shoot him, not in a public place like this where a peeler would be around the corner, yet the man with the box fired anyway. He drew a small pistol; it was big enough to drive a bullet through [SCOPE.sCharacter('deadguy_scope').GetLastName]'s chest. Blood erupted from the ruined vest and he fell to the ground screaming to help, before the air escaped from his punctured lungs. He would bleed out soon. The sky above him mixed with terrified faces and the looming London skyline, the station's awning, into a warm mixture of fading color..."
 rebel_victoria.2.a: "How could we have let this happen?"
 rebel_victoria.2.b: "Deny the Black Hand's involvement!"
 rebel_victoria.3.t: "Black Hand bombs upper class salon"
 rebel_victoria.3.d: "The Refined Gentleman, an upper class political salon, was recently bombed by Victoria's rebel organization."
 rebel_victoria.3.f: ""Would you get me some tea, Alastair?" Barnaby Fetherstonehaugh asked his companion, as he set a spent cigar into a fine porcelain ashtray which itself was perched on a handcrafted rosewood cabinet imported directly from the Chinese Federation. Alastair nodded and walked across the lavish rug laid out across the floor of the Refined Gentleman's saloon, through a thin haze of pleasant incense, then poured a miniscule amount of tea into a small glass cup.\n\n "Your tea, sir", Alastair said to Barnaby, as the latter reclined on his armchair and sipped his tea. Adjusting his monocle, he then proceeded to glance outside, where there was some kind of commotion. A gang of boys was running past the grimy street as two patrolmen yelled for them to stop.\n\n "My, the children these days certainly are----Alastair?" Barnaby squealed as the terrified butler dove behind the armchair, followed moments later by a heavy bomb smashing through the salon's window, with refractive shards scattering across the ruined rug as several visiting gentlemen screamed in horror. The fuse ran out and there was a great explosion fit for the grandeur of Greater Britannia; nonetheless none of the gentlemen were able to witness the settling of this explosion, as by this point they were much too dead to be able to form an opinion about it at all."
 rebel_victoria.3.a: "What? The Black Hand has this capability?"
 rebel_victoria.3.b: "There is nothing we can do!"
 rebel_victoria.3.c: "The police! Notify the police!"
 rebel_victoria.4.t: "Detective Nerdface"
 rebel_victoria.4.d: "London's finest detective, Conan Nerdface, is now on the job."
 rebel_victoria.4.f: ""Pleased to meet you, lad. You're Ian, aren't you?"\n\n The second, younger man nodded nervously. "You're the famous detective Conan Nerdface!"\n\n "It's pronounced 'Dover', lad," the great detective said, twirling his magnifying glass about his fingers. "Now that the metropolitan police has assigned you under my supervision, it's about time we headed off." \n\n The detective grabbed his coat and deerstalker cap off his shelf, then led Ian outside, onto the filthy crowded streets of London, off to procure a clue..."
 rebel_victoria.4.a: "Buy a drink, and head off to the scene!"
 rebel_victoria.5.t: "An addict's revelations"
 rebel_victoria.5.d: "An Opium addict in a London Opium Den, the Blue Lotus, has given important clues as to the background of the Black Hand's bombing"
 rebel_victoria.5.f: "By all acounts Lester was a pathetic man. What had once been at least a somewhat handsome figure was now entirely ensared within the filthy red mattress next to the small vial of opium he so greedily indulged himself on nearly every ten seconds or so. Needless to say, Ian found this quite disturbing, but Conan was not fazed at all.\n\n"How can you stand this?" The former asked, to which Conan simply shrugged and attributed his tolerance to years of exposure to various environments bordering on inhospitable. Indeed, the area surrounding Lester was at least somewhat clean; the same could not be said for the rest of the room: dirtied cloths and god knows what else, uncleaned soot, and fluids Ian dared not identify. But Conan had set his priorities straight. He was doggedly interrogating the intoxicated, disheveled figure at his feet for any clues as to the whereabouts of the Black Hand.\n\n"I don't know anything about him! He didn't even come to my house last night!" the man suddenly shouted to them without any warning. He struggled to stand, yet only fell back down in his drugged stupor.\n\n Conan grimaced at the pathetic figure below him, then turned and flashed his most professional smile at the terrified serving girl. "Say, do you know where this lad lives?"\n\n"I'm not supposed to..." she muttered, blushing as Conan leaned closer.\n\n"Official business for Greater Britannia, Miss," he grinned at her, flashing his silver badge.\n\n"Oh, well," she muttered softly. Conan tilted his head invitingly, and she whispered an address into his ear. That was the end of their business in the Blue Lotus."
 rebel_victoria.5.a: "The plot thickens."
 rebel_victoria.6.t: "At the manor house"
 rebel_victoria.6.d: "The clues given at the Blue Lotus have led the detectives to a prestigious manor house in London."
 rebel_victoria.6.f: ""I can't believe an opium addict like that came from the manor house," Ian said, wiping sweat from his brow. Even by carriage it had taken them a while to arrive, and the final stretch of sun-baked pavement in the manor pavilion was all the more unbearable.\n\nSome bigwig or another had ordered the manor constructed a century ago, and since thn it had towered above its surroundings in a marbled and imposing sort of way. Inevitably, a few of the new buildings brought along by the march of industry and progress had put it to shame in grandeur, but the original effect was not lost on the two, especially given that an unspoken rule upheld with the aid of large flows of cash ensured no taller buildings would be found for several hundred feet in any direction."

 je_burgsys_appear_reason: "With our recent humiliating defeat, many in our country have become discontent with our current political system. We are not achieving the full potential of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], they say. The Burgundians, as they are called, would like to see radical changes in the organization of our country. More police, less liberties, and away with the minorities they say are poisoning our great Nation. Will the current establishment take kindly to this?"
 burgsys_complete: "Should sentiments continue unimpeded, the Burgundians in the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('burgsys_ig').GetName] will achieve total dominance, and perhaps finally gain a chance at putting their ideas into practice."

 french_army_limits: "Limits on the French Army"
 french_army_limits_reason: "Following the subjugation of France, a limit for the size of her army was set. Initially, this value was 35% of the size of the army of Greater Britannia, although theoretically this value is subject to change."
 
 doctrine_je: "The matter of a doctrine"
 doctrine_je_reason: "Long gone are the days where the sole determinant in an army's victory or defeat was its strength and perhaps morale. Modern theorists have busied themselves with concocting a plethora of pretty little doctrines they have assured us are the keys to victory in the treacherous battlefields of today. We may as well humor them, and see for ourselves if there is any merit to their eccentric ideas."
