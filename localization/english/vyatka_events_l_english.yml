  vyatka_events.1.d: "General Pyotr Nezhdanov is bothered by visions in his sleep of... eyes?"
  vyatka_events.1.f: "Warlords were to be ruthless. It was a fact of life, and something that Pyotr had gradually come to learn over the time following Area Eastland's collapse. Occasionally he was bothered by the acts he was forced to perform---and at such a young age, too, when the heart had not yet hardened---but, as with all things, he supposed it was inevitable. He had ordered several officers executed already, but it was not his fault: they were conspiring against him, the poisons found within their rooms a testimony to their guilt. He would have to kill many more in the years to come, a thought which had once unsettled him but did so less every day now.\nA new sence of normalcy had come over his life, and now the only thing that bothered him were the visions.\nWhen he was lying in his gilded bed at night, he would sometimes close his eyes and a strange vision would wash over him. A beautiful pair of eyes floated past his field of view, a deep shade of brown that probed his soul, stripped the hard layers away from him and left him raw and afraid. It was an unsettling sensation. He did not like what it reminded him of: weakness, which he knew he would rid himself of eventually."

  vyatka_events.2.t: "An encounter on the Severnyes"
  vyatka_events.2.d: "Pyotr encounters his dream at last, on the sandy slopes of the Severnye hills"
  vyatka_events.2.f: "Pyotr had once loved to roam the Severnye Hills just ouside Vyatka as a child. The cool wind had blown against his face, and around him the trees almost seemed to absorb sound. Those memories were fading into the recesses of his mind now, and it troubled him to find he could not recall much of how he had once spent so many of his days out here, amid nature, doing whatever he pleased. He had not even returned to the hills for quite some time. It had been... what, a year? Two years? His entourage insisted on travelling with him, but he had denied them this. The hills would be his own again, for however fleeting a time.\nIt was chilly and he could feel this even through his coat, but he did not mind this. For perhaps the last time in a long, long stretch of life, he was free from the stresses of the president-general's post.\nIn the distance, he saw a flash of metal, which gradually faded into a dull shade of gray, piquing his interest. It was much too large to be Britannian weaponry, so what was it? He drew his pistol and approached cautiously.\nThere was a girl there standing outside of the metal device with its smooth casing and strange emblems in yellow and black. She was wearing a loose jacket of a type that Pyotr had never seen before.\n\n"What are you doing here?" Pyotr demanded, pointing his pistol at her. Could she be a spy? He'd never seen a machine like that before. Yet she was so young, looked so innocent and scared. And those eyes..."

  vyatka_events.3.t: "Miloslava, visitor from the future"
  vyatka_events.3.d: "Pyotr becomes acquainted with the girl from the future"
  vyatka_events.3.f: "She stared back at him with a terrified expression that compelled him to slowly release his tight grip on his pistol, then place it gently back into its holster. Seeing this, the fear gradually faded from her eyes, and now she gradually took a tentative step towards him.\n"Are you a soldier?" she asked him.\n"Not just any soldier! I'm Pyotr Nezhdanov, ruler of Vyatka!"\nShe looked at him again and began to giggle, covering her mouth with a hand almost swallowed by the loose sleeve. "That can't be! He's been dead for a hundred years or so. You're a cosplayer, aren't you?"\nPyotr was adamant. "I don't know what that is. And I'm alive!".\n"But that can't be," she said, perplexed. "It's 2024. And Vyatka isn't anywhere near here."\n"But that can't be. It's [year], and this is Vyatka!"\nThey stared at each other for a few moments, each thinking the other delusional. Pyotr wanted to take her, lock her away in an asylum somewhere. Yet her eyes---it was curious, they were just like the ones he saw in his dreams---were so honest, almost pleading for him to believe her.\n"I don't know why you are here," he said solemnly, "but my name is Pyotr Nezhdanov. I am the president-general of the great""
