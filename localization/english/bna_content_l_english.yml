 je_mid_integration_reason: "The midwest, recently wrested from the [SCOPE.sCountry('irc_scope').GetName], will be a useful asset in projecting North American power to the south. Under the name of stabilizing and developing the new nation, we can build the midwest into a secure bastion to protect our interests now and forever"

 mid_bureaucracy_var_tt: "Has already established bureaucratic institutions in the future Midwestern state"
 mid_military_var_tt: "Has guaranteed the security of the future Midwestern state's border"
 mid_bureaucratic_oversight_desc: "The Midwest has successfully been wrested from the [SCOPE.sCountry('irc_scope').GetName] and fallen into our hands with the pretext of establishing a buffer state. The region lacks bureaucratic infrastructure to operate over its population, which we will have to establish in the region before we can turn control to local authorities... loyal to us, of course."
 mid_military_oversight_desc: "With the [SCOPE.sCountry('irc_scope').GetName] present on the midwestern border, it is necessary to establish a military presence in order to to secure the secure security for the security of the secure state of North America, forever secure in the security of its secure security."
 mid_establish_administration_desc: "We have arranged all affairs for the Midwestern state and left behind a solid administrative and military base to forever hold off any advances the [SCOPE.sCountry('irc_scope').GetName] may attempt in the wake of our 'retreat'."
 mid_instill_loyalty: "Instill loyalty in The Midwest"
 mid_instill_loyalty_desc: "Although we have arranged for loyal officers to take positions within the new state, most residents are still remnants from the [SCOPE.sCountry('irc_scope').GetName], whose loyalties lie not with us but a dying state soon to be wiped from the memory of the world forever. Investments in loyalty will be most beneficial for our efforts at promoting stability in the region."
 not_other_establishment_tt: "Is not currently dealing with the logistics of another productive institution in the Midwest"
 mid_foreign_agriculture: "Establish agriculture in the Midwest"
 mid_foreign_agriculture_tt: "The newly established Midwestern state must not be allowed to develop too great an economic base lest it begin to desire independence. Control over its agriculture and therefore the livelihoods of its citizens will greatly increase its dependence on foreign grain."
 not_foreign_agriculture_tt: "Has not already funded agriculture in the Midwest"
 mid_foreign_mining: "Construct mines in the Midwest"
 mid_foreign_mining_tt: "The Midwest, while not particularly rich in resources compared to other regions across our vast nation, still contains a certain amount of useful resources. This of course is a mere side note. Most importantly, establishing services surrounding the mines will allow for a qualified workforce to be safely amassed around the border with the pretext of development.."

 mid_foreign_war_industry: "Establish war-adjacent industries in the Midwest"

 je_split_usa: "The partitioning of America"
 je_split_usa_reason: "War has broken out with the [SCOPE.sCountry('usa_scope').GetName]. Once we successfully annex their territories, we will implement our original strategy and partition the nation into three substates that will be much simpler for us to influence."
 
 north_american_path.1.t: "The North American Path"
 north_american_path.1.d: "With nationalist sentiments rising across the country, the people of Britannian North America are at last seeking to claim what is rightfully theirs."
 north_american_path.1.f: "The North American state has long been silent. In the relative calm following the Conquests, a fragile stability has persisted between the four northern powers: the Iron Confederacy, the United States of America, and German North America. Despite troubles in Mexico recently, the north has been spared most of the turmoil that has increasingly appeared through the cracks of Britannia's dominance.\n\nBut this situation is not one that most are satisfied with. Britannian North America stands as by far the most powerful state out of the four, with the full backing of Greater Britannia's might, however long it may persist. Many now are questioning: if the nation truly has the power to dominate the continent, why should it not?\n\nAnd, some suggest, does it really need to place itself at the mercy of a falling power across the sea?"
 north_american_path.1.a: "We answer to North America, and North America only."
 north_american_path.2.t: "The northern concession"
 north_american_path.2.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('bna_scope').GetName] demands our northern states"
 north_american_path.2.f: "[SCOPE.sCountry('bna_scope').GetName] has cited national security and the spread of civilization in its demands for the cession of Confederacy-controlled Manitoba, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. The North American State has long pressed against our borders since the United States was defeated during the reconquest, which extended the Confederacy's life, but only now have they attempted to wrest any territories from our control. While the Confederacy is lucky to have survived so long in the shadow of such a powerful neighbor, most hold no illusions as to the result of a war against Greater Britannia's puppet. Still, simply ceding the territories would be quite a humiliation, one that none in the [SCOPE.sCountry('irc_scope').GetName] would like to see."
 north_american_path.2.a: "We have no other choice. Cede the states."
 north_american_path.2.b: "We cannot let them have their way with us."
 north_american_path.3.t: "War in the Americas"
 north_american_path.3.d: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('irc_scope').GetName] has refused our demands."
 north_american_path.3.f: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('irc_scope').GetName] has refused our demands for it to cede its three northernmost states, threatening the safety of North America, her people, and the advance of civilization into the savage interior of the Americas. Our diplomats have already issued a strongly worded protest to the local authority, and the military is currently at the ready and awaiting command. A single order is all it will take for our troops to sweep the entirety of the [SCOPE.sCountry('irc_scope').GetName]."
 north_american_path.3.a: "The northern states are ours!"
 north_american_path.3.b: "We don't want to escalate this into an international situation."
 north_american_path.4.t: "Tragedy of a nation"
 north_american_path.4.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('bna_scope').GetName] demands a Midwestern buffer state"
 north_american_path.4.f: "[SCOPE.sCountry('bna_scope').GetName] has demanded we cede a segment of our east to them to establish a buffer, in reality under their control. An envoy of [SCOPE.sCountry('bna_scope').GetName] bureaucrats appointed to govern the future territory has already reached the border, presumably preparing to begin administering the new territory the moment control is transferred to the [SCOPE.sCountry('bna_scope').GetAdjective] government.\n\nWhile unpleasant, this event was not outside of expectation, especially given the previous aggression over the northern territories. It has become increasingly obvious that [SCOPE.sCountry('bna_scope').GetName] is taking the path of the once-powerful United States which it crushed by its own power during the reconquest. With no foreign power to intervene this time, how will the [SCOPE.sCountry('irc_scope').GetName] fare?"
 north_american_path.4.a: "Transfer authority over the region to [SCOPE.sCountry('bna_scope').GetName] authority immediately."
 north_american_path.4.b: "They have taken enough from us!"
 north_american_path.5.t: "An insignificant defiance"
 north_american_path.5.d: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('irc_scope').GetName] refuses to cede its Midwest"
 north_american_path.5.f: "It was rather unexpected for the North American demand to be refused. In fact, the civil servants who had already been transported to the border with the Confederacy expecting to quickly take up occupations in the new state were given a rude shock when their procession was stopped by an armed Confederate patrol. The two forces stood at opposite ends of the border for several hours, as unrest slowly began to spread through the North Americans. What had happened to the promises made? Why would such an insignificant country dare to defy a direct command from a child of the greatest empire the world had known?\n\nStaring into the eyes of the defiant savages across from them, sweat began to roll down the brows of the civil servants. Suddenly they felt less like men, the proud representatives of an enlightened, powerful nation, and more like terrified children who had only begun to discover that for some, the affairs between nations was much, much more than a profitable game."
 north_american_path.5.a: "Teach them a lesson."
 north_american_path.5.b: "Withdraw our procession. This is a battle not worth fighting."
 north_american_path.6.t: "An American conference"
 north_american_path.6.d: "A conference to decide the future of the [SCOPE.sCountry('usa_scope').GetName] has opened in the capital"
 north_american_path.6.f: "Having finished dealing with the Iron Confederacy, future North American ambitions have turned to the United States of America. Several options have been put forward by the representatives, each with advantages and drawbacks. The fate of a nation will be decided here."
 north_american_path.6.a: "Demand the United States' complete annexation"
 north_american_path.6.b: "Offer for them to become our dominion"
 north_american_path.6.c: "Split them into a loose confederation under our supervision"
 north_american_path.7.t: "A maddened nation's ultimatum"
 north_american_path.7.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('bna_scope').GetName] demands our annexation"
 north_american_path.7.d2: "[SCOPE.sCountry('bna_scope').GetName] demands we become their dominion"
 north_american_path.7.d3: "[SCOPE.sCountry('bna_scope').GetName] demands we loosen our confederation"
 north_american_path.7.f: "The little manila envelope was placed on the table, and all the representatives of the United States Congress fell silent. They knew what bowing to the North American demands entailed: national humiliation, and perhaps the complete disappearance of the [SCOPE.sCountry('usa_scope').GetName] as a nation. The representatives erupted into heated debate, not over possible strategies to deter [SCOPE.sCountry('bna_scope').GetName], but rather whether their symbolic resistance would garner some sympathy on the international stage...\n\nOne congressman's motion knocked the envelope off of the table. It drifted to the ground as the din in the room began to subside, and the most powerful men in the nation fell silent. Some could be seen wiping tears from their eyes, already missing the lavish living that would soon disappear along with their doomed positions of power."
 north_american_path.7.a: "Resistance is pointless and may draw the ire of our new masters."
 north_american_path.7.b: "At least some symbolic resistance will elevate our position in the eyes of the world."
 north_american_path.8.t: "Prelude to devastation"
 north_american_path.8.d: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('usa_scope').GetName] has refused our demands and has begun preparations for war"
 north_american_path.8.f: "[SCOPE.sCountry('usa_scope').GetName] troops, few in number as they are, have begun preparations for mobilization following the rejection of [SCOPE.sCountry('bna_scope').GetName] demands, an unexpected move given the vast disparity in power and international backing between the two nations. While Britannian authority has remained ambiguous as to whether it will support this particular military adventure, the [SCOPE.sCountry('usa_scope').GetName] remains isolated as ever on the international stage. Should necessity arise, the [SCOPE.sCountry('usa_scope').GetName] will be wiped off the world map permanently."
 north_american_path.8.a: "We will finish what Britannia left incomplete."
 north_american_path.8.b: "We have other concerns. The Americans may consider themselves lucky."
 north_american_path.9.t: "A letter from the north"
 north_american_path.9.d: "Britannian North America has requested that we become their subject before Germany has the opportunity to intervene"
 north_american_path.9.f: "Despite its series of aggressions, few expected that [SCOPE.sCountry('bna_scope').GetName] would dare to take action against [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], long assuming that the position of both countries as subjects of the two dominant powers in Europe guaranteed peace between them. Evidently, this did not concern their leadership in the slightest.\n\nIt would certainly be possible to take this issue to Germany, but if [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is able to resolve this issue on its own, there would certainly be more liberties allowed for in post-war dealings. On the other hand, Britannia is strong, and has invested far more into its American holdings than German has. Three paths present themselves. Which one? Which one will it be?"
 north_american_path.9.a: "Defer to Germany. This is not a situation to take chances with."
 north_american_path.9.b: "We can deal with this on our own."
 north_american_path.9.c: "We cannot overlook the benefits involved in case of capitulation."
 north_american_path.10.t: "A grand opportunity"
 north_american_path.10.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('gna_scope').GetName] has deferred to us as [SCOPE.sCountry('bna_scope').GetName] threatens its borders"
 north_american_path.10.f: "[SCOPE.sCountry('bna_scope').GetName] has demanded our subject, [SCOPE.sCountry('gna_scope').GetName], to become their dominion. As expected of such a loyal subject they have deferred the issue to us, and now the fate of the two great colonial nations of America will be determined by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. While it would be seen as an overresponse, a war would at least have reasonable justification, and most importantly provide an opportunity to test [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetName]'s strength. Who knows; maybe the strongest empire in the world is no longer at its peak..."
 north_american_path.10.a: "Let the conference begin!"
 north_american_path.10.b: "We cannot risk drawing the ire of [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetName]."
 north_american_path.11.t: "American Committee: first meeting"
 north_american_path.11.d: "The American Committee has begun discussion over whether we should demand that [SCOPE.sCountry('bna_scope').GetName] cede several of its southernmost provinces to [SCOPE.sCountry('gna_scope').GetName]"
 north_american_path.11.f: "Upon the opening of the conference, several members with connections in [SCOPE.sCountry('gna_scope').GetName] have insisted that the [SCOPE.sCountry('gna_scope').GetAdjective] colony be expanded to the north at the expense of the [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetAdjective] aggressor. Others have not found major issues with this proposal, and it is expected to be included in the final list of demands following the war's conclusion."
 north_american_path.11.a: "Is this even a question worth asking? Add it to the list and move on to the next proposal."
 north_american_path.11.b: "We wouldn't want to see our subject so powerful it begins to desire more than what we are generous enough to grant it."
 north_american_path.12.t: "American Committee: second meeting"
 north_american_path.12.d: "The committee has begun considerations over demanding that [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetName] release Burgundy as an independent state."
 north_american_path.12.f: "Of [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetName]'s two footholds in continental Europe, the entire Burgundian region borders Germany directed. Were it wrested from [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetAdjective] control, not only would its former ruler be weakened, the region would also be opened to further German influence."
 north_american_path.12.a: "An excellent idea."
 north_american_path.12.b: "But we must live in fear of the abominations we may create."
 north_american_path.13.t: "American Committee: third meeting"
 north_american_path.13.d: "For the final meeting, the committee has began reviewing the third and last proposal: to wrest from France territories rightfully ours."
 north_american_path.13.f: "Alsace-Lorraine is German in nature, and France has no rightful claims on the Swiss states, save for the fact that they were rewarded to it, a pittance of a compensation compared to the regions it lost. Therefore, these territories may as well become German. The only question is, will the second power of the world devote any attention to the lands belonging to a shadow of an empire?"
 north_american_path.13.a: "Germany grows!"
 north_american_path.13.b: "These lands are not worth the international animosity we will draw."
 north_american_path.14.t: "A place under the sun"
 north_american_path.14.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('ger_scope').GetName] has concluded its conferences on the various territories of [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetName] and is fully prepared for war."
 north_american_path.14.f: "[SCOPE.sCountry('bna_scope').GetName] was truly foolish to challenge the might of [SCOPE.sCountry('ger_scope').GetName], foolishly thinking a victory or two against isolated and dying states meant it held any true strength. Now it is its own turn to be swept aside like detritus by the rapids of history."
 north_american_path.14.a: "War approaches."
 north_american_path.14.a: "All's right with the world."
 north_american_path.15.t: "Above the sun"
 north_american_path.15.d: "The time has come to establish Britannian North America's dominance and break free from Greater Britannia's control."
 north_american_path.15.f: "The country is more than ready to face Greater Britannia now, the empire that teeters on the brink of collapse. Regardless of the actual disparities in power, the public and government alike are united in their determination to display the power of the Greater North American Empire. Down with the dominance of the isles!"
 north_american_path.15.a: "The Empire ends here!"
 north_american_path.16.t: "American Dawn"
 north_american_path.16.d: "Greater North America has successfully defeated Greater Britannia and has gained sovereignty and dominance."
 north_american_path.16.f: "Everything is over now. Greater Britannia has been defeated and all about the country the masses are celebrating the beginning of a new era.\n\nSince seven in the morning the Britannian embassy was surrounded by masses waving North American flags with police refusing to intervene; this persisted until the afternoon when the military put an end to the unrest reluctantly. Regardless, Britannian influence in the Americas has taken a massive blow."
 
 je_north_american_path: "The North American Path"
 je_north_american_path_reason: "Britannian North America was the result of a consolidation between Britannia's remaining American holdings and Canada following the reconquest of much of the former American east. Yet this massive state remains undeveloped, absurdly, with a superior and glorious people idly occupying the land, unable to fulfill its great destiny: to someday subjugate the entirety of the North American continent. With new ideas spreading, though, many are increasingly inclined to believe a dominant North America may not be as far off as it seems."
