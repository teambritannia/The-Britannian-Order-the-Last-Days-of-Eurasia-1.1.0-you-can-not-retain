 ideology_tbo_agrarian: "agrarian"
 ideology_tbo_agrarian_desc: "Agrarians hold that most of modernization's impacts have been or will be negative. Factories pollute air, water, and soil, while in cramped cities men become isolated from their neighbors and family. The cities, like giant monsters of steel, have swallowed the souls of the men who foolishly wander within, while scraping the increasingly barren land clear of all but soot-infused wastes.\n\nAn adherence to subsistence traditions, they maintain, is the solution. When the nation is not running itself down for a few percentage-points of economic growth but instead promoting harmony, stability, and the natural cultivation of nourishing produce, it may then truly free itself from the sisyphean struggles of modernity and place itself firmly on the packed dirt road to enlightenment."
 ideology_tbo_interventionist: "interventionist"
 ideology_tbo_interventionist_desc: "Interventionism was born in reaction to the raw horrors of the first waves of industrialization. These men saw the destructive power of industry, how it swallowed men, even women, *children*, ground them up and spat out their crushed remains. Yet they saw the enormous potential of it too, when the countryside was submerged beneath a sea of steel and figures were ticked out on endless sheets and entire cities sprang from where there had previously been nothing.\n\nThe interventionists set out to resolve this contradiction. They believed they could constrain the market, harness its power with the reins of the state. They avoided the pitfalls of the Centralists and Collectivists, who foolishly believed the market could fall under the power of men. They skirted the errors of the deregulationists, who played with a fire they could not control. In the narrow ground between the scorched paths they forged a new road, not to any lofty ideal, but forward, a great financial ship forever at sea."
 ideology_tbo_primitivist: "primitivist"
 ideology_tbo_primitivist_desc: "Primitivists reject industry as the root of all problems of modernity, in a similar vein to agrarians, yet they go a step further. While agrarians merely wish for the nation's economic focus to return to agriculture, primitivists instead advocate for the total dismantling of all industry.\n\nIt can be clearly seen that industry corrupts the hearts and minds of men; only a return to the ages of raw flesh can purify the modern soul."
 ideology_tbo_collectivist: "collectivist"
 ideology_tbo_collectivist_desc: "Collectivism began to emerge following the development of truly modern socialist ideas, and advocates for the collective ownership of the workplace. After all, it is they who produce the goods. Is it not justified that they should receive the fruits of their labor, rather than the wealthy few who leech off their blood and sweat?\n\nSimilar ideals have existed since time immemorial, and a primitive pseudo-form of collectivism was present in the years of stone and clay, yet in those days equality was an equality of poverty. Today, with advances in science propelling a burgeoning industry, true realization of the scientific and methodical collectivist ideal is at last at hand."
 ideology_tbo_centralist: "centralist"
 ideology_tbo_centralist_desc: "Centralism was born following collectivism, yet rivals the former in dedicated literature and philospohy. The collective ownership of the workplace is the ideal, yes, but the mistake of the collectivists was to view their society as a rose in a vaccum. But a beautiful ideal. surrounded by capitalist powers, will only be doomed to invasion, destruction, and post-morten glorification.\n\nNew developments in mathematics have outlined a new possibility: the state's direct planning of the economy, where foresight and efficient resource allocation on a national scale propels unprecedented speeds of development, where full modernization can transform even a backwards agrarian state to an industrial powerhouse.\n\n"But at what cost?" the idealists will say. Friends, do you expect the workers to place a price tag on their survival?"
 ideology_tbo_traditionalist: "traditionalist"
 ideology_tbo_traditionalist: "Before there was all this nonsense of production, efficiency, investments and all the new-fangled terms the economists have invented to dazzle us with, there was the time-tested traditional economy. Serfs labored joyfully on their land, and their benevolent rulers lived in harmony with them fro their majestic castles. And so, for thousand of years, stability reigned.\n\nToday the economy is like a ship rocked by a storm---the storm of industrialization. The ship rocks this way and that, and all the petty economic systems are shouted loudly like desperate commands by terrified sailors. Yet the traditionalist is intelligent. Like any commonsense gentleman, he sits in a dignified manner at his post and waits inevitably for the storm to pass."
 ideology_tbo_deregulationist: "deregulationist"
 ideology_tbo_deregulationist_desc: "The first whistles of steam heralded the liberation of humanity from the feudal order, unveiling a new force: the market, as powerful and immovable as the laws that govern the motions of the celestial bodies. Some fools wish to cast reigns upon the market, or even to control it. Yet they have all but failed, and the deregulationist throne triumphs above the financial accomplishments of the greatest empires of the world.\n\nThe invisible hand in its almighty workings navigates the economy forward, at time through rough waters, but always true to its destination. Who are we to attempt to meddle with its cryptic workings?"
 ideology_tbo_reactionary: "reactionary"
 ideology_tbo_reactionary_desc: "As science and philosophy have advanced through the past two centuries, there has inevitably been backlash against these extreme new ideas. The reactionaries say that the world worked fine before, with the beautiful ideals of a racially pure nation with a populace living in harmony. Time, along with external forces, whether a foreign religion, culture, or ethnicity, have dampened this greatness into a faintly glowing shell of its former self.\n\nWhen prosperous times inevitably end and economic downturn strikes, the reactionaries appear, and so begin their solutions to restore the greatness of their nation."
 ideology_tbo_conservative: "conservative"
 ideology_tbo_conservative_desc: "Without the bite of reactionaries, conservatives still hold that society was better in the past. The modern man is corrupted; he foolishly offers 'rights' and 'freedoms' to those less than deserving of equality of the state. No, things are better as they are now than they will be, and things were better then than they are now.\n\nThe old nobilities of europe are quite fond of conservativism, and from their manors they sigh at the mantle and look back fondly upon an age when their ancestors ruled the countryside like kings."
 ideology_tbo_progressive: "progressive"
 ideology_tbo_progressive_desc: "Progressivism originated in the enlightenment, when egalitarian ideals began to emerge despite the inevitable restrictions that the era cast upon them. The progressives of today remain in a similar position, though with modernized stances stemming from advances in theoretical political philosophy.\n\nReforms must be implemented, of course, but it is equally important to preserve the fabric of society against overambitious projects with potential for destabilization. Thus, the progressive seeks to strike out a balance between stability and what they see as dangerous overextension."
 ideology_tbo_radical: "radical"
 ideology_tbo_radical_desc: "Radicals lack the patience of mere progressives in the matter of things. While the progressives wax on about 'preserving the balance' and 'maintaining stability', discrimination and violence kill thousands. For some, time is precious and not to be wasted on indecisive dilly-dallying, and that is how the radicals generally get on with things.\n\nGenerally viewed as violent extremists by more moderate reformists, radicalism has been confined to the fringe in most major European powers, with notable exceptions in several scattered movements, and has found a comfortable presence in various states far from the core of Britannia's influence."
 ideology_tbo_pacifist: "pacifist"
 ideology_tbo_pacifist_desc: "Pacifism on a large scale arose in reaction to the horribly destructive wars waged during Britannia's subjugation of the world's various powers, with much of northern France as well as Eastern Europe laid to waste. The pacifists advocate for near-total demilitarization of all the great nations of the world, as they see militaries as the root of evil. In the military-dominated societies following the ectasy of the great conquests pacifism has little hold on state affairs, but this has not prevented various branches from developing, with firey debate over the extent of demilitarization and the structure of post-reorganization armies, if any."
 ideology_tbo_isolationist: "isolationist"
 ideology_tbo_isolationist_desc: "While pacifists advocate for an end to all militaries, this ideology was difficult to apply to states in the far reaches, who were under constant pressure from foreign influences and military threats at times.\n\nIn recognition of these conditions, armed isolationism became the prevalent replacement in such nations, as well as more pragmatic factions within Europe herself.\n\nThe isolationists, rather than seeking to dismantle all armies, instead propose a powerful army or at least enough of one can act as a deterrent to foreign forces, something mere moral pressure alone is not enough to achieve in their eyes."
 ideology_tbo_jingoist: "jingoist"
 ideology_tbo_jingoist_desc: "Seeing the great victories brought to Greater Britannia, and her allies by extension, jingoism grew massively in popularity. The people had seen for themselves the raw, destructive power that a military granted, and the hundreds of tons of riches flowing into the capitals of such glorious nations.\n\nMilitarism has proposed a solution to its own bottomless consumption of resources: plundering the wealth of lesser nations, weakening them further... it is a perfect system, a system that sustains itself into eternity.\n\nSo the jingoists say."
 ideology_tbo_social_darwinist: "social darwinist"
 ideology_tbo_social_darwinist_desc: "In the Britannian age, the social darwinists say, there is no more room for the weak. It is every man for himself, and with new discoveries in inheritance and natural laws it has become quite fashionable to apply animalistic selection to human populations. The theorists say that when the strongest survive, then the populace as a whole will inevitably strive towards perfection.\n\nSocial darwinism manifests itself as a belief in the dismantling of any and all welfare institutions, even privately managed ones, and to let the poor fend for themselves. After all, if they are really so deserving of the ability to produce offspring, they will have to *earn* it."
 ideology_tbo_moralist: "moralist"
 ideology_tbo_moralist_desc: "Moralism has been present in various forms throughout the centuries, whether through concerned individuals or the clergy. Moralism rejects state interference in matters of welfare, distrusting bureaucratic authority, instead organizing aid for the needy through private or church organizations, relying on the generosity of relatively well-off citizens to maintain the needs of the lowest classes.\n\nWhile social darwinists with their rising prevalence have criticized moralism for tolerating weakness, it remains an acceptable patchwork system for many well-intentioned folks."
 ideology_tbo_institutionalist: "institutionalist"
 ideology_tbo_institutionalist_desc: "Institutionalism derived its roots from the beginning of republicanism, with the idea that states could be arbiters of equality. The institutionalists claim that states have the power and responsibility to aid the poor, despite any bureaucratic or financial costs involved.\n\nSome have criticized institutionalism as a drain on state resources, while others perceive it as a dangerous expansion of state power. Despite this, institutionalists maintain that it is the responsibility of the state to ensure the welfare of its people, in line with the republican principles that have mostly fallen out of favor in modern times."
 ideology_tbo_communist: "communist"
 ideology_tbo_communist_desc: "The political ideologies of socialism in conjunction with its economic aspects, arising from further development of socialist theories. Communists reject both monarchism and traditional republicanism as rule of landowners and bourgeoisie respectively in their materialistic view of the world, and state that proletarian rule is the logical next stage in human history.\n\nCommunism has been vehemently rejected by most traditional ideologies, holding limited support even within radical circles. However, its appeal to the masses is undeniable, and this is a powerful force behind various communist movements worldwide."
 ideology_tbo_monarchist: "monarchist"
 ideology_tbo_monarchist_desc: "Since the beginnings of civilization humanity has been ruled by monarchs, and the monarchists see no reason the present should be any different. While dangerous new ideas have threatened the formerly indestructible royal institutions across th globe, states guided by kings and queens remain.\n\nMonarchists believe rule by royalty is the most effective government, whether total or with some supplementation by a cabinet, or even parliament, and even in states that have already deposed their feudal rulers vestiges of monarchism remain, ready to pounce on any chances at restoration."
 ideology_tbo_theocratic: "theocratic"
 ideology_tbo_theocratic_desc: "While monarchism and republicanism struggle for dominance, theocracy has largely been resigned to the shadows. Compared to the powerful palpal states of old, theocrats have little hold on the states of today, yet in some aspects the clergy is more powerful than ever before, with rulers falling on divine justification for their ambitious exploits.\n\nMost theocrats propose a rule by the clergy which would represent the will of their god or gods, with a radical few instead proposing for an interim government to rule in place until the arrival of their deity on earth."
 ideology_tbo_militant_socialist: "militant socialist"
 ideology_tbo_militant_socialist_desc: "Despite support from working-class movements few communist forces have successfully achieved much politically, and the militant socialists argue this is because the idealism of the first socialists blinded them to reality.\n\nMilitant socialism itself prioritizes defense of the worker's state, with means such as armed isolationism and censorship to ensure that dissidents---often a front for foreign influence, they maintain---do not project their petty grievances to society as a whole.\n\nUnsurprisingly they have been harshly criticized by milder or more utopian radicals as an impure abomination, though the militant socialists counter that they, for all their purity, have had little success in all their forms."
 ideology_tbo_republican: "republican"
 ideology_tbo_republican_desc: "Republicanism grew from the enlightenment and culmulated in the failure of the French revoution, and the American state before the Reconquests. While it has tempoarily been set back in the Britannian age, support for its principles remains unwavering in underground movements across the globe.\n\nIn stark contrast to the autocratic governences that dominate the world's affairs, the Republicans instead call for equality, where the people themselves determine the workings of the state that rules them, represented by either a parliament or some form of presidential structure. Repressed by mainstream authority, republicans nonetheless have a number of splits within themselves, with various disagreements over the specifics of governance, concerning matters such as who can be considered a citizen, the extent the state should play in their lives, and various other issues."
 ideology_tbo_dictatorialist: "dictatorialist"
 ideology_tbo_dictatorialist: "In the modern age monarchs have inevitably fallen out of date, as with the agricultural kingdoms they ruled over. Yet petty despotism lives strongly, and with the efficiency of the republican institutions the potential for a new form of autocratic state arises.\n\nDictatorialists present the idea of the state as a paternalistic figure, one that, while lacking the capacity to meddle with the lives of its citizens constantly, should reserve the authority to punish various forms of deviance as it sees fit. Depending on the definition of success used, this form of government can certainly be said to have had great effect in the regions where it has been attempted."
