 britannian_prosperity.1.d: "'The greatest nations of the world / arund the sun like jewels twirlled..."
 britannian_prosperity.1.f: "No empire of the past could compare to Greater Britannia as she stood, and a good chance was there that none of the future would ever come close to matching her splendor, if they were to exist at all. For, as the Cromwells will insist, ruling from London, the highest authority on the planet, Britannia is truly eternal.\n\nIn the first wars in Europe she routed the French and Spanish; in the second she crushed Russia. In the second Asian wars all the power of the orient could not withstand the iron tide from the Isles; and Africa in her entirety plunged into a turbulent anarchy. Indeed, no power in the world would even dare think of defying her, any more than a fish would wish to jump upon land."
 britannian_prosperity.1.a: "Hail Britannia! Hail Cromwell! Heil Britannia! Heil Cromwell!"
 britannian_prosperity.2.t: "Sunset"
 britannian_prosperity.2.d: "Britannia has fallen at last. The remains of Eurasia move to scavenge the remains of her festering corpse"
 britannian_prosperity.2.f: "In retrospect, the signs of Britannia's coming fall were quite clear. From the situation in Mexico long ago, to the Occitan rebellion, to the split with Germany, to the current North American insurgency, the illusion of a solid, united Commonwealth was in reality nothing but a facade for the rot, the disgusting stagnation and corruption at the core of this decaying beast.\n\nThe empire has at last been overwhelmed, and requests for secession are now pouring in from every corner of the globe. Some from nationalist pressure, other from opportunist Britannians themselves hoping for a little empire of their own, no matter which corner of the globe they were assigned to.\n\n[placeholder britannia leader] reflected for a moment from [placeholder ruler gethisher] palace, soon to be torn down by the starving masses deprived of the wealth flowing in from the colonies that had long ago been stripped to the bone. Was it worth it? The empire saw a brief moment of glory, a golden age even, that brief period when they had been intoxicated by gold and flowing silk. How foolish they had been, to think that it could have last forever. [ruler first name] once believed that the Britannian jackboot, heel cruelly twisted into the backs of colonials, would be enough to hold it all in place for the next day, next week, month, year...\n\nNow [gethisher] was alone amid the ruin---yes, he could see that soon this would be a ruin. And amid the silence [gethisher] screamed in agony to the sky."
 britannian_prosperity.2.a: "The lamps are going out all over Greater Britannia; we shall not see them lit again in our life-time."
 
 je_britannian_prosperity_reason: "Greater Britannia, on the surface, seems to be in an eternal golden age. Yet upon closer inspection of the Empire Under the Sun reveals that its position is, in fact, quite precarious. As nationalist sentiments rise across its conquered territories, only time will tell whether the Britannian Empire will survive into the twentieth century in its full glory."
 je_britannia_collapse_tt: "Should various colonial wars overwhelm Britannia's might, the Empire will lose control over its expansive holdings, resigned to an uncertain fate for the remaining Home Islands..."

 britannian_prosperity.3.t: "The Mexican War"
 britannian_prosperity.3.d: "Mexico has declared war on Britannia-controlled North Mexico in a bid to reclaim its lost lands"
 britannian_prosperity.3.f: "Mexico had declared war on Greater Britannia! Quite an unexpected development, thought the thousands of civil servants busied with administrative work in what many were already triumphantly crowning the Capital of the World. To put down this minor menace on the border; well, it would take little more than a few battalions shipped across the world to deal with this annoyance of a diplomatic situation.\n\nA few entertained the thoughts of what might happen should more of these diplomatic situations arise, but soon shook them off. No, Greater Britannia would stand forever, no matter what a little egotistical state a little to the west of nowhere would demand they recognize."
 britannian_prosperity.3.a: "Britannia lives."
 britannian_prosperity.4.t: "The Britannian Opportunity"
 britannian_prosperity.4.d: "A war between Britannia and Mexico presents an opportunity for Dai Nam to place Britannian Indochina under its control"
 britannian_prosperity.4.f: "Britannian Indochina is little more than a patchwork state, thrown together by lazy Britannian authority following the asian wars. Today it is plagued by inefficiency, not to mention constant internal strife. Yet now its sole source of support, the Empire that produced this abomination, is embroiled in war in Mexico.\n\nDai Nam, meanwhile, remains free. And though we share little with our subjugated neighbors to the east, it would certainly be a profitable venture were we to make a... small incursion into its territory. After all, do we really have much less of a claim on this land than the Britannians do?"
 britannian_prosperity.4.a: "Chance!"
 britannian_prosperity.4.b: "This plan is insane!"
 britannian_prosperity.5.t: "The Vietnam War"
 britannian_prosperity.5.d: "Capitalizing on the opportunity of Britannia's war against Mexico, Dai Nam has declared war to take control of Britannian Indochina."
 britannian_prosperity.5.f: "While the Indochinese situation had looked concerning since the inception of the state, if it could be called that, few imagined that things would take such a turn for the worse.\n\nAttemping to take advantage of the current situation in Mexico, in seems that Dai Nam has launched a full-scale invasion of [scope indochina], something even the wildest analysis had not predicted they had the bravado to do. Currently, the relatively weak and ill-equipped, poorly trained Indochinese ground forces are being overrun by the well-prepared Vietnamese.\n\nMany see direct Britannian intervention as the only course to save Indochina, yet the time taken to transfer troops currently tied up in Mexico or stationed in Europe remains an unknown."
 britannian_prosperity.5.a: "This is a disaster!"
 britannian_prosperity.6.t: "One more time, one more chance"
 britannian_prosperity.6.d: "[north america] has declared war on us for their independence"
 britannian_prosperity.6.f: "Just as with Mexico so many years ago, no man in the entirety of the Empire had forseen this. [north america] had become a wild card with its conquests, yes, but to think that it believed itself holding its own against the full might of [greater britannia]! This was what nobody could see, not the myopic bureaucrats behind their stacked sheafs of paper they scrawled marks over as their eyes glazed over, not the wealthy nobles from their gilded palaces enroaching upon the fields of the starving peasants, not even the Great Emperor of Britannia. They were grounded in their own reality, where their power was absolute, and the very laws of nature were dictated by the whims of Britannia's might.\n\nThe nature of this conflict, while superficially similar, is quite different from the American Revolution crushed alongside of the french nearly half a century ago. This time it is a young empire testing her strength against her old superior, and the leaders of the insurgency have made it more than clear that they desre nothing short of the replacement of themselves as the dominant power in the Americas.\n\nNorth American forces are moving swiftly to occupy positions near Newfoundland and other southern regions in proximity to Britannian colonies. However, many speculate that this is no longer necessary, as the shocks brought about by this event to the Britannian order will deal more than a devastating blow to the once-mighty empire."
 britannian_prosperity.6.a: "The last days of Eurasia are at last at hand."
 
 je_economic_recovery: "Economic recovery"
 je_economic_recovery_reason: "When Greater Britannia fell, so did the pride of the british people. No longer would their monuments dot all corners of the globe; no longer would every imaginable good flow into the busy ports of London. Ahead of them was a long and winding road, one that will lead them to only a fraction of what was once theirs.\n\nFilled by overwhelming pain and longing, the british people continue, under the hostile gazes of all Eurasia, a fate they brought upon themselves. Because what is there to do now, but get up and stumble forward as the blood slowly dries?"
 recover_economy: "Wealth from any possible source has prevented the complete collapse of the Britannian economy."
 recover_economy_fail: "The economy has failed to recover from the disastrous effects of the empire's collapse."
 rec_sell_burgundy: "Sell Burgundy its independence"
 rec_sell_burgundy_desc: "A local chicken farmer has offered to buy the region of Burgundy from us, at no small price. It would do us no good to hold on to this land; we may as well peddle it off to the highest bidder."
 rec_sell_brittany: "Sell Britanny to France"
 rec_sell_brittany_desc: "With the Britannian economy in tatters and a relatively stable France, we cannot afford to hold onto our territory there any longer. We may as well sell it to them lest they try to wrest it from us by force later."
 
 tt_tribute_cooldown: "Has not demanded tribute from Germany in the past two years"
 
 rebel_victoria.1.t: "The Rebel Victoria"
 rebel_victoria.1.d: "Situation of the traitor Alexandrina Victoria and her treacherous anti-Britannian organization"
 rebel_victoria.1.f: "Even as the mighty Greater Britannian Empire struggles to hold on to its vast colonial holdings, the empire's home isles, its most precocious core, are not safe, either. Had the Cromwells not taken over Britain then Alexandrina Victoria might've had a chance at the throne, however far-fetched a hope.\n\n Yet now she leads, or at least is suspected to lead, a loose coalition termed by the press as the 'black hand'. Having already carried out several high-profile assassinations on important public officials, they are a dangerous force to the stability of Greater Britannia."
 rebel_victoria.1.a: "We will keep a close eye on this situation"
 rebel_victoria.2.t: "Black Hand shoots [SCOPE.sCharacter('deadguy_scope').GetFullName]"
 rebel_victoria.2.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('deadguy_scope').GetFullName] has been shot by Victoria's rebels in London"
 rebel_victoria.2.f: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('deadguy_scope').GetFirstName] looked at his watch and frowned. The train was running late; it was already a minute or so past the time it was supposed to have arrived. For a public figure as important as himself this was an utter disgrace to his dignity; it was already outrageous that it had not arrived early for him.\n\n Bored, he surveyed the crowd and took in the other passengers, many of whom seemed strangely unbothered by this irritating disruption that would throw his delicately packed schedule completely out of balance. The filthy masses crowded left and right, with worn caps peeking over the sea of heads. One carried a large package that required his full strength to lift. Another carefully held an ornate wooden box that looked to be some kind of heirloom. They did not concern [SCOPE.sCharacter('deadguy_scope').GetLastName]; he was above the rabble. He was a servant of Greater Britannia, of the greatest empire of the world.\n\n He did not think that anyone would dare to shoot him, not in a public place like this where a peeler would be around the corner, yet the man with the box fired anyway. He drew a small pistol; it was big enough to drive a bullet through [SCOPE.sCharacter('deadguy_scope').GetLastName]'s chest. Blood erupted from the ruined vest and he fell to the ground screaming to help, before the air escaped from his punctured lungs. He would bleed out soon. The sky above him mixed with terrified faces and the looming London skyline, the station's awning, into a warm mixture of fading color..."
 rebel_victoria.2.a: "How could we have let this happen?"
 rebel_victoria.2.b: "Deny the Black Hand's involvement!"
 rebel_victoria.3.t: "Black Hand bombs upper class salon"
 rebel_victoria.3.d: "The Refined Gentleman, an upper class political salon, was recently bombed by Victoria's rebel organization."
 rebel_victoria.3.f: ""Would you get me some tea, Alastair?" Barnaby Fetherstonehaugh asked his companion, as he set a spent cigar into a fine porcelain ashtray which itself was perched on a handcrafted rosewood cabinet imported directly from the Chinese Federation. Alastair nodded and walked across the lavish rug laid out across the floor of the Refined Gentleman's saloon, through a thin haze of pleasant incense, then poured a miniscule amount of tea into a small glass cup.\n\n "Your tea, sir", Alastair said to Barnaby, as the latter reclined on his armchair and sipped his tea. Adjusting his monocle, he then proceeded to glance outside, where there was some kind of commotion. A gang of boys was running past the grimy street as two patrolmen yelled for them to stop.\n\n "My, the children these days certainly are----Alastair?" Barnaby squealed as the terrified butler dove behind the armchair, followed moments later by a heavy bomb smashing through the salon's window, with refractive shards scattering across the ruined rug as several visiting gentlemen screamed in horror. The fuse ran out and there was a great explosion fit for the grandeur of Greater Britannia; nonetheless none of the gentlemen were able to witness the settling of this explosion, as by this point they were much too dead to be able to form an opinion about it at all."
 rebel_victoria.3.a: "What? The Black Hand has this capability?"
 rebel_victoria.3.b: "There is nothing we can do!"
 rebel_victoria.3.c: "The police! Notify the police!"
 rebel_victoria.4.t: "Detective Nerdface"
 rebel_victoria.4.d: "London's finest detective, Conan Nerdface, is now on the job."
 rebel_victoria.4.f: ""Pleased to meet you, lad. You're Ian, aren't you?"\n\n The second, younger man nodded nervously. "You're the famous detective Conan Nerdface!"\n\n "It's pronounced 'Dover', lad," the great detective said, twirling his magnifying glass about his fingers. "Now that the metropolitan police has assigned you under my supervision, it's about time we headed off." \n\n The detective grabbed his coat and deerstalker cap off his shelf, then led Ian outside, onto the filthy crowded streets of London, off to procure a clue..."
 rebel_victoria.4.a: "Buy a drink, and head off to the scene!"
 rebel_victoria.5.t: "An addict's revelations"
 rebel_victoria.5.d: "An Opium addict in a London Opium Den, the Blue Lotus, has given important clues as to the background of the Black Hand's bombing"
 rebel_victoria.5.f: "By all acounts Lester was a pathetic man. What had once been at least a somewhat handsome figure was now entirely ensared within the filthy red mattress next to the small vial of opium he so greedily indulged himself on nearly every ten seconds or so. Needless to say, Ian found this quite disturbing, but Conan was not fazed at all.\n\n"How can you stand this?" The former asked, to which Conan simply shrugged and attributed his tolerance to years of exposure to various environments bordering on inhospitable. Indeed, the area surrounding Lester was at least somewhat clean; the same could not be said for the rest of the room: dirtied cloths and god knows what else, uncleaned soot, and fluids Ian dared not identify. But Conan had set his priorities straight. He was doggedly interrogating the intoxicated, disheveled figure at his feet for any clues as to the whereabouts of the Black Hand.\n\n"I don't know anything about him! He didn't even come to my house last night!" the man suddenly shouted to them without any warning. He struggled to stand, yet only fell back down in his drugged stupor.\n\n Conan grimaced at the pathetic figure below him, then turned and flashed his most professional smile at the terrified serving girl. "Say, do you know where this lad lives?"\n\n"I'm not supposed to..." she muttered, blushing as Conan leaned closer.\n\n"Official business for Greater Britannia, Miss," he grinned at her, flashing his silver badge.\n\n"Oh, well," she muttered softly. Conan tilted his head invitingly, and she whispered an address into his ear. That was the end of their business in the Blue Lotus."
 rebel_victoria.5.a: "The plot thickens."
 rebel_victoria.6.t: "At the manor house"
 rebel_victoria.6.d: "The clues given at the Blue Lotus have led the detectives to a prestigious manor house in London."
 rebel_victoria.6.f: ""I can't believe an opium addict like that came from the manor house," Ian said, wiping sweat from his brow. Even by carriage it had taken them a while to arrive, and the final stretch of sun-baked pavement in the manor pavilion was all the more unbearable.\n\nSome bigwig or another had ordered the manor constructed a century ago, and since thn it had towered above its surroundings in a marbled and imposing sort of way. Inevitably, a few of the new buildings brought along by the march of industry and progress had put it to shame in grandeur, but the original effect was not lost on the two, especially given that an unspoken rule upheld with the aid of large flows of cash ensured no taller buildings would be found for several hundred feet in any direction.\n\n"Morning to you, good sir," Nerdface said to a servant at the door who swung the entrance open for them in one swift motion, nose uptured. The moment they were inside, the door was practically slammed shut behind them.\n\n"Good grief. Even the servants here are posh," Ian muttered, looking backwards with resentment. Conan simply shrugged with no other reaction to this semtiment.\n\n"Now, we have three different suspects. There is Sir Ornstein Sordenhouve down in the Opium section. Very rich optium fields in India, you know; highest production in the world or so I've heard. And then we have Torngard Rittenskanders, who manages the rich vineyards somewhere that matters little to us. And finally, Oswald Nevilleton, who works with livestock right here in the home counties. All of these three deal with goods sourced from areas of Black Hand activity, and quite interestingly they have all been in the vicinity of Victoria's contacts in the past few weeks. Interesting, eh?"\n\nIan nodded along, secretly praying that Nerdface would be able to take care of everything himself."
 rebel_victoria.6.a: "Let's hope Conan knows what he's doing."
 rebel_victoria.7.t: "Sir Sordenhouve"
 rebel_victoria.7.d: "Conan and Ian have begun their interrogation of the first of the suspects, Sir Ornstein Sordenhouve (pronounced Orvil)"
 rebel_victoria.7.f: "When they knocked on the door, they heard a furious scrambling sound as papers fell to the floor and were pushed this way and that on what was presumably a beautifully crafted and polished desk. The man inside, Sir Sordenhouve, called for them to come in.\n\n"Oh, hello. What brings you two good sirs here?" Sordenhouve asked sluggishly, calmly brushing several chunks of unidentified substance he carefully positioned his body to block into a rubbish bin.\n\nIan frowned. "Good god, even his speech is slurred."\n\nSordenhouve laughed very slowly several times. "Ho, ho, that's what managing Britannia's supplies does to you! Ho, ho. We buy narcotics from the Chinese Federation cheaply---very cheaply!---and then we sell themm back there, for much, much more. Ho, ho! Would you like a sample?"\n\nAt this the intoxicated knight offered the rubbish bin to a disgusted Ian, who was about to isse a strongly worded rebuttal before Conan cut him off with a warning gaze. "That's very nice and all, sir, but we're here to investigate you."\n\n"Investigate ME? Servant, take this bin away. Yes, thank you. To the incinerator." A servant standing at attention outside quickly took the bin from Sordenhouve's hands and disappeared into the hall. "Let me tell you fine gentlemen. I'm a law abiding citizen! I've never commited a single crime in my life. I'll let you have all the opium you want!"\n\n"I want to know what you were doing with Douglas Jameston," Conan said. "Jameston, as far as we know, is a Black Hand contact."\n\n"Ho, ho. You must be joking! let me tell you---" Sordenhouve attempted to stand and issue a reprisal, yet tumbled off his chair and found himself sprawled on the floor among scattered, opium-crusted documents.\n\n"Let me tell you. Jameston---he has nothing to do wih me. I paid him a few chunks of opium to do some accounts for me once, he was so good at maths and such. Didn't even want opium! Insisted on taking cash. What a strange fellow. But I don't know him."\n\n"We'll see about that," Conan said. "Ian, we're on to the next man.""

For some time, this arrangement has been at least somewhat effective, yet now cracks are beginning to appear in what once appeared to be the most solid arrangement in French history.\n\nThe French Revolution, crushed by Britannian intervention, has revived partially in the form of its ideals spread by the fledgeling Occitan republican movement, something no analyst across the Commonwealth could have predicted.

 je_occitan_crisis: "The Occitan Crisis"
 je_occitan_crisis_reason: "Some say that republicanism in France died half a century ago, when Britannia's invasion put an end to the French Revolution, some believed for good. Yet it is evident that the radicals have not given up on their vain cause. Remnants of their organizations, as well as a new generation poisoned by their destructive ideology, have taken control of Languedoc.\n\nThe regional administration has been expelled in the chaos and all levels of government have been thrown into temporary disarray, even as the Occitans seek to expand their influence further.\n\nThe inertia of the French State itself is frustatingly slow, with those across all levels of government refusing to recognize the Occitan threat, instead choosing to go about their business for the sake of their salaries. It remains to be seen whether old France will survive the flames... or perhaps be born anew?"
